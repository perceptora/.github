# Perceptora

**Perceptora** is an open research initiative dedicated to building the next generation of perceptual intelligence â€” systems that understand the world through time-aware vision, dynamic reasoning, and concept evolution.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between perception and cognition by designing AI agents that can:
- perceive the world with temporal awareness,
- refine their understanding through active feedback,
- simulate internal models of reality, and
- form and evolve concepts across time and experience.

This project integrates insights from cognitive science, neuroscience, artificial life, and philosophy of mind into modular, reproducible, and openly extensible architectures.

## ðŸ”¬ Core Themes

- **Latent Temporal Embedding (LTe)**: Perceiving with temporal context  
- **Perceptual Recurrent Loop (PRL)**: Feedback-driven recognition and refinement  
- **Active World Model (AWM)**: Predictive internal simulation of the environment  
- **Dynamic Concept Lattice (DCL)**: Meaning and value shaped by history and relations

## ðŸŒ± Get Involved

We welcome collaborations with researchers, developers, and philosophers who share an interest in time-aware AI, cognitive modeling, and open-source intelligence.  
Stay tuned for our initial modules and prototypes â€” coming soon.
